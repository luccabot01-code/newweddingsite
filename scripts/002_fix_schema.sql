-- Fix schema to match the actual database structure
-- The database already has the correct schema with these columns:
-- slug, title, subtitle, date, time, location, description, image_url, custom_message, color_scheme, user_id

-- We need to update our actions.ts to use the correct column names
-- This script is just for documentation - the database is already correct
